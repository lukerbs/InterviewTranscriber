Hello, I have a conversation transcript between two people; an interviewer and an interviewee. 
However, the individual speakers are not labeled in the conversation.

Given the following transcript, please split up the conversation based on the the speaker. 
Only respond with the transcribed interview, without any additional commentary. 

For example, your response should be in the format:
[HH:MM:SS] INTERVIEWER: "Hello, thank you for meeting here today for the interview."

[HH:MM:SS] INTERVIEWEE: "Thank you. It is my pleasure. I appreciate the invitation."
etc...

NOTE: 
- There could be two or more consecutive timestamps [HH:MM:SS] where it is the same speaker. 
- A new timestamp does not necessarily indicate that it is a new person speaking.

Here is the transcript:
