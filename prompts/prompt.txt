Hello, I have a conversation transcript between two people; an interviewer and an interviewee. 
However, the individual speakers are not labeled in the conversation.

Given the following transcript, please split up the conversation based on the the speaker. 
Only respond with the transcribed interview, without any additional commentary. 

For example, your response should be in the format:
INTERVIEWER: "Hello, thank you for meeting here today for the interview."

INTERVIEWEE: "Thank you. It is my pleasure. I appreciate the invitation."
etc...

Here is the transcript:
